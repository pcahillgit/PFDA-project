# Programming for Data Analytics Project

## About this Project
In this project I analyse data from a Spotify audio dataset imported from Kaggle.



## Get Started
I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and write this [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with the libraries used within this notebook. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.

## Get Help
Please feel free to log any issues you spot on the Git repository page or to email me with any queries (my student email is included below).

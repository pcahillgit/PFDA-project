# Programming for Data Analytics Project: Decades of Music

## About this Project
In this project I analyse data from a Spotify audio dataset imported from Kaggle. In it I use the key principles thought in the programming for data analytics module such as pandas dataframes, data visualisation with matplotlib, random number generation and regular expressions to conduct an analysis of this dataset.

## Get Started
I used [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to create and write this [Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) and recommend you download and use the same to view the work.

Anaconda will pre-install Python along with the libraries used within this notebook. Visual Studio Code is a tool which allows the user to view and edit code.

To use the random song generator programme, just type `python random_track.py` as a command line argument in the VS code terminal and hit enter. This will output a song from the dataset plus some information on that particular track.
